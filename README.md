## Project Description
InstaChat is an Instagram clone that allows online users to chat with each other and react to pictures on their feed. When the webpage is loaded, you will automatically see a picture feed with posts from other users. You can log in and chat with other users, react to the posts, create new posts and even reply to posts.  Only logged in users can chat, reply to the photo posts and create new posts. Users not logged in have the ability to only react to photos. When you create a post, you will be instructed to create a caption, post a picture using the image URL and create tag names using #. To find the image URL, right click on the photo you want to post from Google Images then right click “Copy Image Address” and paste that into the “Post Picture” box. The chat has a toxicity check that makes sure the message sent are not toxic. This creates a friendly online environment to interact with others.  You can view who is online by looking at the left sidebar. InstaChat is a fun and enjoyable web page to interact with people via group chat and photos.
